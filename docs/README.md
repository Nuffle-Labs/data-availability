# NEAR Data Availability architecture docs

For our architecture docs, we make use of [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).
It's a simple and easy to use architecture-as-code software, with an online editor and various plugins.
Gihub also supports this out of the box within mermaid code blocks.
